                <h2>My Story</h2>

                <p>I am a first-generation student at the University of Oklahoma. I've grown up in the hospitality industry (literally) for as long as I can remember. I started answering phone calls and greeting customers at the mere age of 8 years old seeing as both my parents were hotel managers. Of course, it wasn't anything like the Suite life of Zack &amp;Cody but it was still pretty fun nonetheless!

                    <p>In my senior year of high school, like most students, I still didn't know what I wanted to do when I got older. I took my first Web Design class and enjoyed it a lot because of how much creativity and coding that was involved.I have always enjoyed doing puzzles because they are challenging and coding was no different to me. I realized I wanted to go into the business field after taking a Marketing course at a Francis Tuttle Technology Center. The program was a two-year program which I finished within a year and recieved my Associates Marketing &amp; Communication. On top of my classes, I also competed in the 2014 Oklahoma DECA State Competition and won 4th place in my division. Although I did not make it to nationals that day, I was still happy because I learned a lot through my project and gained some experience in business.

                        <p>However, it wasn't until my sophomore year that I found my true passion. I wanted to combine technology and business together since I was already familiar with both topics. Being the curious person I am, I remember asking myself "what major can I do that will combine these two things?". In my sophomore year of college I took my first MIS class. Being the curious person I am, walked up to my professor on the first day of class and asked him if there was room for creativity in this major and he responded, "Absolutely!". Right then an there, I knew what I wanted to be when I grew up. That same day, I went to my advisor and declared Management Information Systems as my major and have enjoyed it ever since!</p>
